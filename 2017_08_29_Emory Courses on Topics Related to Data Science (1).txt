* QTM120:  Math for quantitative sciences. Part 1 of the QTM courses which are recommended for students who want to brush up on topics in math and computer science before jumping into machine learning. 
o This course is slated to be offered online in summer 2018. 
* QTM210: . Part 1 of the QTM courses which are recommended for students who want to brush up on topics in math and computer science before jumping into machine learning. 
o This course is slated to be offered online in summer 2018
o 
* BUS 550 - Data and Decision Analytics (uses excel and SAS/LPM so nothing fancy programming wise, but a very well taught and practical course on how to make business decisions from data)
* BUS 651 - Strategic Decision Analysis 
* BUS 550 is a pre-req and again mostly uses excel but focuses on game theory concepts
* BUS 554 - Advanced Data Science (this one is more computationally intensive and teaches more "big data" analysis with cloud computing and such)
